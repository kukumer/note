# Introduction to Corporation Finance
==从Manager的角度来理解公司金融==

## basic corporate finance framework
![image](B2677E4C7FEB47F784F472775F02C5E3)

As a mananger,you should concern about:   
(1)the Capital Structure:  
- Debt holder
- equity holder/shareholder

(2) how to invest your capital  
- working capital is the money needed to run a business rather than the money used to buy buildings and equipment when starting the business.
- Capital budgeting, or investment appraisal,  is the process of allocating resources for major capital, or investment, expenditures.planning process used to determine whether an organization's long term investments such as new machinery,research development projects,etc.

(3)(4)(5)how to distribute the earnings
1. distribute to investors
2. pay off the debt
3. retained for re-investment


composation(they are greedy):
1. shareholder/debt holder
2. manager
3. employee
4. custom
5. supplier
6. government

公司三大功能：
financing
investment
payoff

## forms of business of organizations 
![image](E9FBF8A348DA475CA8E84008E0FB77CD)
### for proprietorship&partenship

1. advantages:
- ease of formation
- subject to few regulations
- No corporate income taxes(instead,personal income tax)

2. Disadvantages:
- difficult to raise captial
- unlimited liability(over registered captail)
- limited life(==?==)
- difficult to transfer ownership(liquidity risk high)
- financing cost high

> in partenship, one of owners assumes all liability.

<b>Limited partenership</b>  
General parterner(manager) = unlimited liability  

Limited partener = 
limited liability

> For all kinds of forms of business above, limited number of investors


### corporation
shares -> shareholder

1. advantages:
- unlimited life
- easy transfer of ownership 
- limited liability
- ease of raising capital

2. disadvantages:
- double taxation(corporate tax & personal income tax while former kinds just need personal income tax)
- cost of set-up ad report filing.(public companies-> information cost: report annual & quarter/ prospectus)
- agency problem(conflict of interests)

#### goals of the corporation  
![image](557686C8AD454F19833AD4B8D9F4817B)
maximize the firm value -> debt is fixed -> maximize shareholder wealth = P * number of shares -> maximize the price

```
graph LR
A-->B
```


what kind of price?
- market price
- book price(balance sheet history)  
- true price(intrinsic value/real price)
> ideally it's the intrinsic value.

EMH:historical/public/Insider

for long-term investors,max intrinsic value,not profit


market price/profit/sales/growth/lower risk is a short concept.-> so they are not the objectives of the corporates,is to increase the intrinsic value/combine risk&return

## the agency problem
shareholders&ownership contradict with manager/CEO  -> conflict of interest

max shareholder wealth price / max CEO's wealth(eg. compensation:salary&bonus/private benefit/reputation/power)not the fixed salary, but related to the performance.
in default,we consider the price/shareholder wealth as intrinsic price.

direct cost  

indirect cost:

f(size)->in order to enlarge the size & no distribution -> invest some bad projects

replacement cost: eg.some CEO M&A companies in other field which only he knows in order to increase his power.

enjoy quiel life: CEO do nothing

monitor:
internal:
1. concentrated ownership - >block shareholder > 5%
2. short-term/long-term
3. hedge fund /pension fund:hedge fund's investors are more likely to monitor
4. shareholder->board directors(size)->CEO activities

board directors:
1. dependent directors
2. independent directors: not professal

external:bad performance -> M&A
parachutes

FCFF(free cash flow of firm):
1. debt ↑
2. dividend↑

CSR(corporate social responsibilities)
max price,max CSR

max CSR or price   
Chapter 1 Q3 Q4 Q6 Q8

Q3.<b>Goal of the Firm Evaluate:</b> 
the following statement: Managers should not focus on the current stock value because doing so will lead to an overemphasis on short-term profits at the expense of long-term profits.

A: It's not all true.
1. the market price is the observable and constantly updated,it's the direct reflection of the intrinsic value and the performance of the company recently.
2. the shareholders concern about the market price instead of intrinsic price.
3. But it's true that the managers should not purchase the short-term profits at the expense of long-term profits.

Q4.<b>Ethics and Firm goals</b> Can the goal of maximizing the value of the stock conflict with other goals,such as avoiding unethical or illegal behavior? In particular, do you think subjects like customer and employee safety, the environment, and the general good of society fit in this framework, or are they essentially ignored? Think of some specific scenarios to illustrate your answer.

A: Under some circumstance, the goal can concide with other things.For example, some companies spend lots of money to aid or help others in order to earn a good reputation.

Unfortunately,some companies may face a dilemma.Some companies polluting the environment are supposed to spend lots of money and efforts to deal with the pollution according to the regulations,of course,which reduces the overall value of the company .Besides,as Marx said,the essence of capitalism is exploitation. In order to earn more, the welfare of workers or employees are not that good.

CSR:Community/corporate Governance/diversity/Employee Relation/Environment/Human Rights/Product
benefit:Positive Media Coverage/Reputation/reduce tax and fine/insurance    
cost:cash outflow/agency cost(CEO'preference)/hard to evaluate the function of CSR

Q6: <b>Agency problems</b>Suppose you own stock in a company. The current price per share is $25. Another company has just announced that it wants to buy your company and will pay $35 per share to acquire all the outstanding stock. Your company’s management immediately begins fighting off this hostile bid. Is management acting in the shareholders’ best interests? Why or why not?

A: In my opinion,it depends.In the short-term,the management is not acting in the shareholders' best interests.Because the shareholders are only concern about how much they get from the stocks.In the other words, they concern about the market price instead of the intrinsic price.While in the long-term,it depends on the comparison between intrinsic value and market value.

Q8:<b>Agency Problems and Corporate Ownership</b> In recent years, large financial institutions such as mutual funds and pension funds have become the dominant owners of stock in the United States, and these institutions are becoming more active in corporate affairs. What are the implications of this trend for agency problems and corporate control?

A:Because the funds have the professional skills and more attention,they can provide stronger supervision.In this way,the agency problems may be relieved.Also,as the super stockholders,the funds have more power in the management of the companies,which will affect the ways of controlling corporates.

# statement
## the annual report
### balance sheet
provides a snapshot of a firm’s financial position at one point in time.

![image](0D55547C61B44DA9988A5B553B40D966)
- Current Asset(CA):short-time asset less than 1 year,such as cash.
- Fixed Asset(long-term):tangible (depreciation)&intangible(amortization eg. patents/copyright/brands)
- Current liability(CL):include short-term Borrow&accounts payable&accurals
- long-term debt
- equity:common stock&retained earning
- Net Working Capital(NWC):  
NWC = CA - non-interest-bearing CL = CA - (Accounts payables + Accurals)

> the change of NWC is the reflection of Investment (look up to see how to disguist finance and investment)    

> △NWC = NWC08-NWC07   
△NWC ↑ -> outflow   
account payable↑ -> inflow


### Income statement
summarizes a firm’s revenues and expenses over a given period of time.

![image](C8F10539CC4D4DD2A0FC9106CDB49241)
- COGS(Cost of goods sold) 
> Sales minus the COGS is gross profit

- Research & Development(R&D)/Advertisement

> gross profit minus RD&AD is EBITDA(Earnings before interest & tax & DA)

- D&A(depreciation and amortization)

> EBITDA minus D&A is EBIT

- EBIT(Earnings Before Interest and Tax,is the operating profit income)

> EBIT minus Interest expense is 
EBT

- NOPAT(Net Operating Profit after Tax)   
NOPAT = EBIT - T= EBIT(1-Tax rate)   
(assume that the financing is 0)

> how to define finance and invest
> 1. interest-bearing -> finance(short-term borrow/long-term debt,current portion of long-term debt)
> 2. non-interesting bearing -> non-finance(accouts payable,accural)

- NI(Net income)
> EBT minus Taxed is Net Income


### Statement of stockholder's equity
shows how much of the firm’s earnings were retained, rather than paid out as dividends.

### Statement of cash flows
reports the impact of a firm’s activities on cash flows over a given period of time.

## Free Cash Flow(FCF)
FCF = 



EPS = earning(NI)/#shares
DPS = Dividend paid/#shares
BVP = book value equity/# shares

FINANCAIL STATEMENT ANALYSIS
ratio analysis:    
1. trend analysis
2. peer analysis

five major categories of ratios 
1. liquidity
current ratio = current assts/current liabilities

quick ratio = -inventories

2. asset management
inventory turnover:sales/inventory

DSO:Average number of days after making a sale before receiving cash


3. debt management
D/A
TIE = EBIT/Interest expense

4. Profit
Operating margin
Gross margin = sales - COGS/Sales

Basic earning power = 总的利润率 not affected by equity&debt

ROE = NI/Equity = N1/Sales * Sales/Assets* asstes/equity
PM * Asset manage * debt management
= NI/EBT(TAX)*EBT/EBIT(Interest expense)


ROE only concern return ,ignore the risk
- profitability
- market value
P/E = price/earnings per share

M/B = Market price/Book value per share(share可以放到上面的)
在实务中，ROA&ROE的计算得注意分母资产的年限。

# Lecture3 Stocks and Their Valuation
## Dividend Growth Model
Stock price is not related to holding period.

> 持有期不影响现金流

### Non dividend growth model
hypothesis:
- Assume the growth rate of dividend g=0
- All future dividends are constant D
- It is a perpetuity
- Stock price P0 is the PV of the perpetuity，assume the discount rate is rs

$\hat{P_0} = \frac{D}{r_s}$

### Constant dividend growth model
conditon:
- r_s > g
- g is expected to be constant forever
```math
\hat{P_0} = \frac{D_0(1+g)}{r_s-g} = \frac{D_1}{r_s-g}
```
```math
\hat{P_t} = \frac{D_{t+1}}{r_s-g} = \frac{D_t(1+g)}{r_s-g} = \hat{P_{t-1}}(1+g)
```

### 2-stage dividend growth model
![image](6703266F796748BBBDB735FCE104DE02)
```math
P_n = \frac{D_{n+1}}{r-g_c} \\
P_0 = ...
```

### Stock price and return
1. Required return & Intrinsic price

> use CAPM model to caculate the Required return.

![image](96744B6A964346438C8862E82BC338D1)
2. Expected Return & Market Price

![image](3119345EAECD455C92570CDF1E262A0A)

![image](EE9DE56E89814091884BC02D03F1AE92)

3. Actual return   
the transaction happened

![image](CE893E0B3BCD4127A847EEDF4C7DB6D4)

### growth rate
```math
g_{EPS,t} = \frac{EPS_t-EPS_{t-1}}{EPS_{t-1}}
```
Estimate growth rate
- History date
- Analyst forecasted growth rate
- Fundamental analysis

#### Fundamental Analysis
1. ROE is constant

![image](34635CEC528C4E70AE85026BC81CF2CE)

![image](69F3B0D2AA614A9F9E59FD54276F56A6)
2. ROE is not constant

> usually use the former one  


### FCFF model(non-dividend)
firm value V is the PV of all future FCFF 

![image](74D22EF97E054D5FAFB182503074FAE2)

![image](F3BCDBF1EC8944FCB0CD12A9E47FF87C)
> the same as the dividend model

Discounted Cash flow model(DCF model)

FCFE
FCFF是最难估值的，但却是最准确的



通过分红：可预测的现金流



## Tutorial 3 Questions

 

1) **Constant growth**.  Your broker offers to sell you some shares of Bahnsen & Co. common stock that paid a dividend of $2 *yesterday*.  Bahnsen’s dividend is expected to grow at 5 percent per year for the next 3 years, and, if you buy the stock, you plan to hold it for 3 years and then sell it.  The appropriate discount rate is 12 percent.

a) Find the expected dividend for each of the next 3 years; that is, calculate D1, D2, and D3.  Note that D0 = $2.00.

$D_1 = 2.1$

$D_2 = 2.205$

$D_3 = 2.31525$

b) Given that the first dividend payment will occur 1 year from now, find the present value of the dividend stream; that is, calculate the PV of D1, D2, and D3, and then sum these PVs.

PVs = 1.875 + 1.758 + 1.648 = 5.281 

c) You expect the price of the stock 3 years from now to be \$34.73; that is, you expect ![img](file:///C:\Users\82542\AppData\Local\Temp\ksohtml11000\wps1.png) to equal ​\$34.73.  Discounted at a 12 percent rate, what is the present value of this expected future stock price?  In other words, calculate the PV of ​\$34.73.

PV = 24.720

d) If you plan to buy the stock, hold it for 3 years, and then sell it for $34.73, what is the most you should pay for it today?

price = 5.281 + 24.720 = 30.001

e) Use ![img](D:\picture\wps2.png) to calculate the present value of this stock.  Assume that g = 5%, and it is constant.

$PV = \frac{2.1}{0.12-0.05}=30$

f) Is the value of this stock dependent upon how long you plan to hold it?  In other words, if your planned holding period were 2 years or 5 years rather than 3 years, would this affect the value of the stock today, ![img](D:\picture\wps3.png)? Explain.

Answer: Of course not. Because the holding period doesn't change the future cash flow.  

2) **Nonconstant growth.** TingHsin International Group (THIG) has been growing at a rate of 25% per year in recent years. This same growth rate is expected to last for another 3 years, then decline to gn=5%.

​    a) If D0=$1.80 and rs=8%, what is THIG’s stock worth today? What are its expected dividend and capital gain yields at this time, this is, during Year 1?

$D_1 = 2.25$

$D_2 = 2.813$

$D_3 = 3.516$

$D_4 = 3.691$

$P_3 = \frac{3.691}{0.08-0.05}=123.047$

$PV = 2.083+2.412 + 2.791 + 97.679 = 104.965$

$dividend yield = \frac{2.25}{104.965}=2.144\%$

$P_1 = 2.605+3.014+105.493=111.112$

$capitalyield = \frac{111.112-104.965}{104.965} = 5.86\%$

​    b) Now assume that THIG’s period of supernormal growth is to last for 5 years rather than 3 years. How would this affect the price, dividend yield, and capital gain yield?

price↑

dividendyield↓

Captial gain↑

​    c) What will THIG’s dividend and capital gain yields be once its period of supernormal growth ends?

 be stable,not change

CGY = g

DY =  r - g

3) **Nonconstant growth.** Mitts Cosmetics Co.’s stock price is \$58.88, and it recently paid a \$2.00 dividend. This dividend is expected to grow by 25% for the next 3 years, then grow forever at a constant rate, g; and rs=12%. At what constant rate is the stock expected to grow after Year 3. 

 $D_0 = 2$

$D_1 = 2.5$

$D_2 = 3.125$

$D_3 = 3.906$

$D_4 = 3.906(1+g)$

$P_3 = \frac{D_4}{0.12-g}$

$PV = 2.232 + 2.491 + 2.780 + \frac{3.906(1+g)}{0.12-g} = 58.88$

$g =4.759\%$  

4) **calculation of g and EPS.** Sidman Products’ common stock currently sells for \$60.00 a share. The firm is expected to earn ​\$5.40 per share this year and to pay a year-end dividend of \$3.60. 

​	a) If investors require a 9% return and the market is in equilibrium, what is the expected growth rate, g? 

$g = \frac{60*0.09-3.60}{60}=3\%$

​	b) If Sidman reinvests retained earnings in projects whose average return is equal to the stock’s expected rate of return, what will be next year’s EPS? If Sidman continues with the same payout ratio, what will be next year’s dividends? 

$EPS = 61.8*0.09 = 5.562$

$dividend = 5.562*2/3 = 3.708$

5) **Corporate valuation**.  Assume that today is December 31, 2008 and the following information applies to Singapore Airlines:

· After-tax, operating income [EBIT(1 – T), also called NOPAT] for 2009 is expected to be $500 million.

· The depreciation expense for 2009 is expected to be $100 million.

· The capital expenditures for 2009 are expected to be $200 million.

· No change is expected in net working capital.

· The free cash flow is expected to grow at a constant rate of 6 percent per year.

· The required return on equity is 14 percent.

· The WACC is 10 percent.

· The market value of the company’s debt is $3 billion.

· 200 million shares of stock are outstanding.

Using the free cash flow approach, what should the company’s stock price be today?

## Relevant cash flow

RCF: Relevant (Incremental ) cash flow for a project is a **change** in the firm’s overall future cash flow that results directly from the decision to undertake the project.

the notice of calculating RCF:

- $\triangle CF = CF(ACCEPT)-CF(REJECT)$
- after-tax cash flow

should or should not be calculated in cash flows?

- Sunk costs ×
- Opportunity costs √
- Side Effects √

<b>Advantage</b>:  Identifies variables that may have the greatest potential impact on profitability and allows management to focus on these variables  

<b>Disadvantages</b>:

- Does not take into account the range of likely values of the variables as reflected in their ==probability== distribution

- Sensitivity analysis treats each variable ==in isolation== when, in reality, the different variables are likely to be related.

## Scenario Analysis

<b>Case1 : just one variable change</b>

| Case                | Probability | Market size   (per year) |

## Real Option Analysis

Real options exist when managers can ==influence the size and riskiness of a project’s cash flows== by taking different actions during the project’s life.

<b>Two steps</b>:

1. make decision,Accept/Reject the project
2. option value

 **example** : delay/expand/contract/extend/switch/abandon 



<b>example1 : option to delay</b>

<img src="D:\picture\1571904492140.png" alt="1571904492140" style="zoom: 80%;" />

<b>use figure to represent:</b>

<img src="D:\picture\1571904694363.png" alt="1571904694363" style="zoom:80%;" />

<b>notice</b>: when calculate,the NPV can't be negative,the min is 0,means that you reject the project.

<img src="D:\picture\1571904861256.png" alt="1571904861256" style="zoom:80%;" />

However,wait is not also a good choice:

- Delaying the project means that cash flows come later rather than sooner  

- It might make sense to proceed today if there are important advantages to being the first competitor to enter a market.

- Waiting may allow you to take advantage of changing conditions. However, costs may also increase, putting you at a disadvantage if you delay.

<b>example2 : option to expand</b>

Project Z has an ==initial cost of \$500,000==.The project is expected to produce ==A-T cash inflows of \$100,000== at the end of ==each of the next five years==, and has a WACC of 12%.

The expected value of this project should be: 

<center>NPV = 0.1($1,562,758) + 0.9(-$139,522) = $30,706.</center>
Option value:

<center>30,706 – (-139,522) = $170,228</center>
<b>Alternative way to calculate value of the growth option</b>:

<img src="D:\picture\1571927602123.png" alt="1571927602123" style="zoom:67%;" />

Value of the growth option:

<center> 10% (3,000,000/1.125) + 90% (0) = $170,228 (same answer as in previous slide)</center> 
NPV of the first project(project Z):

<center>-500,000 + 100,000/1.12 + 100,000/1.122 + 100,000/1.123 + 100,000/1.124 +100,000/1.125 = -$139,522</center>
NPV of first project plus growth option:

<center>-139,522 + 170,228  = $30,706 </center>
# Lecture 7 Risk,cost of Capital,and Capital Budgeting

<b>the gist of the chapter</b>

![image-20191031144440748](D:\picture\image-20191031144440748.png)

WACC: cost of long-term capital(cost of interest bearing capital)

w: capital structure: use target/optimal instead of current

consistency: A-T capital costs A-T costs  of capital in WACC

$r_d$一般是使用current information(market value)，很少用book/history information.

flotation costs : always small 

$r_d = r^* + IP + MRP + LP + DRP$ 

$r_{RF}$-> Treasury-bond yield

如果换了一些小公司，就是用利息保障倍数->rate rank

优先股：

清偿顺序和股利支付顺序都是居中的

比较debt和优先股：

debt是必须的付的，而优先股就可以考虑不付  	

 EPS必须得去掉PD

Q:道理来说公司债的风险小于优先股，但是为什么公司债的利率在现实中会小于优先股：

公司债的利息全部需要交税，但是优先股只需要部分交税
